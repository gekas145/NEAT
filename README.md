#  NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT)
Implementation of NEAT algorithm described by Stanley K. O. and Miikkulainen R. Due to lack of some specifics in original article this implementation was somewhat inspired by Code Bullets' [NEAT_Template](https://github.com/Code-Bullet/NEAT_Template). 

This implementation was tried out with xor, single and double pole balancing tasks. In general, it coped with all test tasks in well and stable way(surprisingly not finding most optimally sized solutions in xor task).
